JavaScript Assignment 2
Overview

In this assignment, You'll create a Trivia game using JavaScript for the logic and jQuery to manipulate HTML. Be sure to layout this app with valid HTML and stylish CSS.
Before You Begin

Create a GitHub repo called TriviaGame, then clone the repo to your computer.
Create a file inside of the TriviaGame folder called index.html. This is where you'll mark up all of your HTML.
Don't forget to include a script tag with the jQuery library.
Create a folder inside of the TriviaGame folder called assets.
Inside assets, create three folders: css, javascript, images
In your css folder, create a style.css file.
In your javascript folder, create an app.js file; here you'll write all of your JavaScript and jQuery.
In your images folder, save whatever images you'd like to use in this exercise.
Choose a game to build from your options below.

Advanced
Click Here to Watch the demo.
You'll create a trivia game that shows only one question until the player answers it or their time runs out.
If the player selects the correct answer, show a screen congratulating them for choosing the right option. After a few seconds, display the next question -- do this without user input.
The scenario is similar for wrong answers and time-outs.
If the player runs out of time, tell the player that time's up and display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
If the player chooses the wrong answer, tell the player they selected the wrong option and then display the correct answer. Wait a few seconds, then show the next question.
On the final screen, show the number of correct answers, incorrect answers, and an option to restart the game (without reloading the page).
